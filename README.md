* Application info
This application will allow the user to utilize the CLI to generate a site for their development team. The site will include each member's contact information as well as employee IDs and other pertinent professional information based on their role. Presently, the application allows the user to input information for managers, engineers, and interns; although, there is the opportunity to expand the application for teams with a broader variety of roles.

* Use case
The user should run the integrated command terminal from the app.js file (la-unit10-assignment\Develop\app.js) to execute the application. As prompted, the user will enter each team member's information; once each member profile has been completed, the user will be asked if they want to add an additional team member. The user may add team members until all members have been accounted for; when the user chooses the "quit" option, the team with all teammate information will be recorded in the team.html file (la-unit10-assignment\Develop\output\team.html). From there, the user can deploy the application in their browser
